# Example deployment of a  NuoDB CE Cluster with reduced SM and TE cpu
# requirement so it can run in a small OpenShift cluster with limited
# CPU cores.  The storageMode is set to "ephemeral" so it can run in
# OpenShift cluster without requring a Kubernetes persistent volume.
# NOTE: The NuoDB database will be created in volitile storage so the 
# database will be lost when the NuoDB SM is shutdown.
